These two hypotheses could contribute to why morbidity and mortality are greater in males than in females.

On  the  top  of  the  figure,  epidemiological  data  from  the  Italian  Ministry  of  Health  are  reported,  with  respective  gender  distribution  of  cases  and  deaths.  A  schematic  representation  of  SARS-CoV-2  mechanism  of  infection  is  reported:  after  binding  of  viral  spike  pro-teins  to  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  2  (ACE2)  (1),  transmem-brane  serine  protease-2  (TMPRSS2)  primes  S  protein  (2),  favoring  viral  entry  and  infection  (3).  ACE2  is  also  crucial  in  tissue  response  to  viral  infection,  as  it  is  typically  involved  in  the  the  renin–angio-tensin system (RAS), where it converts angiotensin I into angiotensin 1–7 (Ang 1–7), which binds to Mas receptor (MasR) and favors tissue protection,  mainly  by  hypotensive  and  anti-inflammatory  pathways.  Conversely,  ACE  converts  angiotensin  I  into  angiotensin  II/III  (Ang  II/III)  that  binds  to  angiotensin  II  type  1  receptor  (AT1R),  favoring  tissue  injury.  On  the  left,  the  main  mechanisms  involved  in  reduced  COVID-19  severity  and  mortality  in  women  are  proposed:  (a)  ACE2methylation (M, orange dot) is reduced in women, resulting in higher ACE2 expression; (b) ACE2 is located on the X chromosome, which in females is present in two copies, in a region of the short arm where 15–30%  of  genes  undergoes  X  inactivation  Escape  (XiE);  (c)  estro-gens,  produced  by  the  ovary,  promote  ACE2  expression.  Increased  levels  of  ACE2  would  provide  a  larger  pool  for  tissue  protection  (green arrows) after viral entry. On the right, mechanisms involved in male increased susceptibility: (d) androgens, produced by testes, bind to  the  androgen  receptor  and  are  recognized  by  androgen-responsive  elements  (ARE)  in  the  promoter  of  TMPRSS2,  leading  to  increased  expression,  which  in  turn  favors  viral  entry  in  males,  whereas  low  levels  of  androgens  in  women  may  keep  at  low  levels  TMPRSS2  expression,  representing  a  further  protective  factor  for  the  develop-ment  of  COVID-19  infection.  The  lack  of  increased  ACE2  pool  in  men due to low estrogens would favor the ACE pathway (red arrows) in  the  RAS  axis,  which  further  promotes  tissue  injury  and  disease  severity in men, compared with women with the same viral load""}]","Other","Review / Literature Review",[]

Provides fast and high throughput detection and quantification of target DNA sequences extracted from upper respiratory tract using nasopharyngeal swab technique, aimed at diagnosing COVID-19 by targeting specific viral genomes (E, N, S, RdRp genes). 
- Real time isothermal loop mediated amplification (RT-LAMP): fastest diagnostic test for COVID-19, works similarly as RT-PCR but does not require thermal cycling, results within 30-40 minutes. Aimed at targeting the N gene. 
- Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR): SHERLOCK (specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) is most well known CRISPR detection strategy for COVID-19. Results appear on an easy to read strip that is akin to a pregnancy test, able to detect COVID-19 from saliva, good for low resource settings. 
- Serological tests for antigen detection: nucleus protein (NP) can be detected during the first two weeks of infection, nucleocapsid protein (N) can also be detected but has low specificity as N is also present in SARS-CoV.
- Serological tests for antibody detection: antibody IgM and IgG lateral flow immunoassays detect antibody in patients who currently have or have history of COVID-19, although this test cannot distinguish between the two.

- Dendritic cells and macrophages constituting the innate immunity can phagocytose the virus-infected cells and initiate an adaptive immune response.
- CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells for the production of IgM antibodies as an early antiviral immune response followed later by IgG. 
- CD8+ T cells expressing granzyme and FAS ligand with cytotoxic activity eliminate virus-infected cells.
- ACE2 receptor expression on the lung alveolar cells reduces IFN expression and adaptive immune cells infiltrate leading to pulmonary edema.
- Excessive innate immunity and impaired adaptive immune response lead to tissue damage.
- Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 patients exhibit a similar percentage of naive, memory central, and effector CD4+ T cells, in addition to lower naive and central memory CD8+cells when compared to healthy controls.
- ""Grifoni et al highlight 100% CD4+T cells and 70% CD8+T cells have SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific responses in recovered patients.""
- Pathophysiology: ARDS is the main primary complication of COVID-19, and endothelitis leads to the progression of ARDS. Cardiovascular and neurological complications, venous thromboembolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and septic shock contribute to secondary complications of COVID-19 disease.
- Excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines lead to cytokine storms. TNF alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta released by innate immune cells is the major cause of hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19. TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were inversely related to T cell count in patients with severe disease. This suggests IL-6 blockers tocilizumab, sarilumab, and IL-1 beta blockers may have therapeutic benefits in treating the disease.

Therapeutic strategies (Table 1):
- SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells isolated and expanded in vitro from convalescent donors may prove efficacious and beneficial for treating COVID-19 patients.
- Vaccine development should aim at inducing protective T cell and antibody immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with adenovirus type-5 (Ad5-nCoV) employed as the vector.
- Moderna has developed an mRNA-based vaccine coding S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 via liposomal delivery system, which is undergoing clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy.
- Since IL-7 promotes T cell trafficking to infectious sites and increases naive and memory T cells, clinical trials with recombinant IL-7 to restore lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients is underway.
- Since IL-2 promote the proliferation of Treg and T effector cells, trials with recombinant IL-2 to restore normal T cell count is registered. 
- Th17 responses via antibodies against IL-17, IL-17R, and JAK2 may have therapeutic benefits against cytokine storm. 
- Therapeutics targeting PD-1 immune checkpoints (IC) in COVID-19 may induce sustained antiviral immune responses mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells which need to be further analyzed. 
- A combination of anti PD-1 mAb with anti IL-6 and anti IL-1R mAb may prevent hyperinflammation since preclinical studies showed anti PD-1 mAb alone resulted in severe tissue damage.
- Late therapeutic interventions to revert T cell exhaustion and hyperinflammatory response have more beneficial effects than early interventions do, in preventing the pro-infalmmatory responses leading to insufficient immune responses.

T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 recognizes cells expressing ACE2 receptor including epithelial cells and macrophages. In normal immune environment, infected epithelial cells degrade viral particles and present them to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs). CTLs detect viral protein through classical TCR-MHC I interaction, release cytotoxic granules, including granzyme B and perforin, and eliminate infected cells. Additionally, macrophages detect SARS-CoV-2 via ACE2 receptor and present the virus-derived peptides to CD4+ T cells (Th0) via TCR-MHC II interaction. Once exposed to antigen, Th0 cells polarize primarily towards Th1, leading to the release of IFN-γ to eliminate the virus, and Th2 to trigger humoral mediated immune responses and antibody secretion against SARS-CoV-2 virus (A). In incompetent immune environment, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes epithelial cells or macrophages via ACE2 receptor. Viral RNA will replicate by hijacking host transcriptional machinery. These viral progenies will infect multiple cells leading to tissue damage and further lethal complications. In these circumstances, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells fail to provide adequate cell/humoral-mediated immune responses to eliminate viral infected cells. On the other hand, Th0 cells are primed towards Th17 phenotype, resulting in the inhibition of Th1-mediated immune responses (B). In COVID-19, T cells exhausted and overexpress exhaustion markers including PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3 and TIGIT through unknown mechanisms, which eventually lead to lymphopenia. In severe COVID-19 cases, the production of cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-2, IL-10 and TNFα, is increased leading to the generation of cytokine storm which induces further unfavorable outcomes (B).""},{""src"":""https://covid19lst.qualtrics.com/jfe/file/F_2rPIxSrwi9cgumW"",""description"":""Figure 2.

This could restore effective antiviral T cell immunity, and result in beneficial clinical outcomes (A). The use of viral vector-based, mRNA-based or DNA-based vaccines expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to the activation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells via antigen-presenting cells, followed by the activation of B cells and secretion of antibodies by plasma cells (B). In COVID-19 patients, the administration of recombinant IL-7 could enhance T cell receptor repertoire diversity, promote the capacity of T cell trafficking to the lungs and alleviate lymphopenia leading to enhanced antiviral immune response. Low dose recombinant IL-2 could control ARDS and excessive inflammation by expanding and activating Tregs, and possibly increase the level of effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as they express IL-2 receptor.
